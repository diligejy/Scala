## 1. Scala

- Scala is modern, high-level programming language that combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms

- It was created by Martin Odersky and first released in 2004. Scala stands for "Scalable Language" indicating its design to grow with the demands of its users.

- Key features

    - Runs on the JVM: run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
    - Functional Programming: functions as first-class citizens, encourages immutability, and supports higher-order functions.

    - Object-Oriented: Scala is also a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object

    - Concise and Expressive Syntax: it reduces boilerplate code seen in Java, like getters and setters.

    - Type Inference: infer the type of a variable or the return type of a function, reducing the amount of type information the programmer must manually specify.
    
    - Immutability: In Scala, immutability is a first-class concept

    - Case Classes and Pattern Matching: immutable by default and is often used in pattern matching.

    - Concurrency Support: Support for Futures and Promises, and it's known for the Akka framework, which implements the actor model for concurrent computation

    - Interoperability with Java: Scala can use any Java library and can be used alongside existing Java code.

    - Use Cases: Server-side application, Big data processing (notably with APache Spark, which is written in Scala), and parallel batch processing.
